    """Joachim Soltvedt slotted Brann ahead after just five minutes\nManager Stephen Robinson says St Mirren "have had the taste and now want more" European football after their 
Conference League adventure ended in a devastating defeat by Brann.\nJoachim Soltvedt rolled in the opener after a cute cutback to put Robinsonâ\x80\x99s side 2-1 behind on aggregate early in the third qualifying round second leg in Bergen.\nSearching for their first win away on the continent for 44 years, St Mirren did not go down without a fight as Oisin Smythâ\x80\x99s wonderful volley was well saved and Richard Taylorâ\x80\x99s 
close-range header flew too high.\nAs the game went on, it grew incredibly open in the relentless rain and the scent of a St Mirren equaliser was in the air.\nThey were a threat from set-pieces all night and substitutes Fraser Taylor and Alex Iacovitti linked up, with the latter thunderously heading the visitors level with just over 15 minutes left.\nWith the wind in their sails, it seemed that, if any team might grab victory, it would be St Mirren. \nMikael Mandron picked out Toyosi Olusanya, but the striker, who put in a tireless shift, 
slipped in untimely fashion and the chance was squandered.\nFelix Myhre then powered a heartbreaking header beyond Ellery Balcombe with five minutes left before Aune Heggebo capitalised on the visitors\' collapse with 
Brann\'s third on the break.\nThe Norwegians now progress to the play-off round, where they will face Astana 
of Kazakhstan.\nRobinson could not hide his pride for his side. "We score a brilliantly worked corner, a brilliant delivery from young Fraser Taylor and, for 10 minutes, we had them rocking," he told BBC Scotland.\n"Toy slips over when he has a side-foot into the goal - the game could have been very different.\n"Had we played like that over two legs, if we had that belief in the first leg, it might have been a different story."\nRobinson did not shy away from saying his side had to up the ante if they wanted to keep adding stamps to their 
passports.\nHe noted their bravery, their pace and their ability on the ball. Three qualities Brann showed within five minutes of kick-off.\nThough it was the worst possible start for the Buddies, they did not buckle. 
Before they fell behind, Shaun Rooney had shanked a glorious close-range effort and, while the visitors were 
under the cosh for much of the first half, they were hardly torn apart.\nIn the second, they were clearly on 
top and deservedly levelled. Despite their inexperience at this level, they were confident in their play and 
everything Robinson called for was implemented in a marked improvement from last weekâ\x80\x99s show.\nSt Mirren were brave, but when they maybe sniffed a vulnerability in Brann, the Norwegian hosts instead pounced in 
clinical fashion.\nFor the travelling support, their trips abroad - for now - are over. They will not forget 
the scenes that unfolded at Iacovitti\'s equaliser any time soon and can bounce back to Paisley with pride. \nIf the second-half performance is anything to go by, the passports will not be away for long.\nThis video can not be played\nSt Mirren \'have had a taste and want more\' - Stephen Robinson\nSt Mirren manager Stephen Robinson: "I wrote one word on the board before the game and that was belief. I said the only mistake you can 
make tonight is not believing in yourselves because we are good enough to get a result.\n"Levels wise, they are a very, very good side with a great manager and in a brilliant city. The goals we concede, that\'s the big disappointment, every goal is preventable. \n"But we put a performance in tonight that done me and the players proud. It done us justice."\nMatch ends, Brann 3, St. Mirren 1.\nSecond Half ends, Brann 3, St. Mirren 1.\nGoal! Brann 3, St. Mirren 1.

    """Joe Wright\'s early header proved decisive as Kilmarnock advance\nManager Derek McInnes says Tromso "thought they had one foot in the next round" before Joe Wright\'s first-half header sent Kilmarnock into the Europa Conference League play-offs.\nAfter a 2-2 draw in the first leg at Rugby Park last week, McInnes\' side headed to northern Norway as underdogs.\nBut, aided by a deceptive deflection that scuppered goalkeeper Jakob Haugaard, Wright\'s 11th-minute goal proved decisive to send the Scottish side through.\nThe 300-strong travelling support watched on as a robust defensive display ensured Kilmarnock advance to face FC Copenhagen, who beat Czechs Banik Ostrava on penalties, for a place in the league stage.\n"I thought there was an overconfidence [from Tromso], we spoke about that," McInnes told BBC Scotland.\n"We played on the outside of their shape really well in the first half, but behind that there was a real solid shape and we got the all important goal.\n"We wanted to try to continue this run in Europe and we\'ve now got a really exciting tie 
to come."\nUnsurprisingly, it was Danny Armstrong who provided the assist for Killie\'s opener. The winger\'s corner found Wright, whose header clipped off an unsuspecting Vetle Skjaervik\'s shoulder and into the roof 
of the net.\nTromso threatened after going behind, with midfielder Kent-Are Antonsen pulling the strings. His crosses continually caused chaos, with Liam Donnelly and Bobby Wales both called upon to hook clear goal-bound efforts.\nA moment of uncertainty came for the visitors when goalkeeper Robby McCrorie was judged to have 
picked up the ball after already handling it. An indirect free-kick was awarded, but Tromso failed to capitalise.\nThe visitors had dropped deep immediately after the opener and successfully stuck with that defensive shape for the majority of the 80 minutes that followed. \nNot long after the offside flag prevented a Leo Cornic equaliser for the hosts, centre-back Amadou Barry should have levelled when his header crashed off the woodwork from just two yards out.\nA late onslaught from Tromso set up a nervy end to the increasingly feisty encounter, but a resilient defensive effort kept out the hosts as they threw every body forward in the last moments to no avail.\nKilmarnockâ\x80\x99s grit in defence has shone once again.\nAs soon as McInnesâ\x80\x99 men took the lead in the Arctic Circle, there was a noticeable lowering of their defensive line as 11 bodies quickly dropped behind the ball for Tromsoâ\x80\x99s next attack.\nClub captain Kyle Vassell and young, surprise starter Bobby Wales both fluffed chances up the other end in the second half, but it never seemed to unsettle Killie.\nEvery player held their shape well and rarely allowed Tromso a clear sight at goal, while also effectively slowing down play in the latter stages of the tie.\nThe late introduction of Rory McKenzie was also inspired, as a late last-ditch challenge from the midfielder thwarted a promising Tromso attack.\nThe Ayrshire side are now within touching distance of the league stage - and it is down to their battling attitude and 
tactical nous when out of possession.\nThis video can not be played\nTromso were \'over confident\' - McInnes after Kilmarnock win\nKilmarnock manager Derek McInnes: "Last season, we had so many games where we got results from being resilient, hard to play against, strong defensively, everything we weren\'t on Sunday.\n"There was an acceptance from us that we had to defend better and we had to be more confident in our defending. We 
reminded them of how good we have been.\n"[Wright] was in such a poor place on Sunday. He felt like he let everyone down, but in football there\'s always another game. He\'s the guy who made the difference tonight."\nMatch ends, TromsÃ¸ 0, Kilmarnock 1.\nSecond Half ends, TromsÃ¸ 0, Kilmarnock 1.\nFraser Murray (Kilmarnock) is shown the yellow card for a bad foul.\nDavid Watson (Kilmarnock) is shown the yellow card for a bad foul.\nJakob Haugaard (TromsÃ¸) is shown the yellow card for a bad foul.\nTobias Guddal (TromsÃ¸) is shown the yellow card for a bad foul.\nSubstitution, Kilmarnock.
